        <p>
          TechCon began as a small meetup of technology enthusiasts in 2010 and has grown into an international
          conference that brings together developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders. Over the years,
          TechCon expanded from a single track of talks to a multi-day event with workshops, panels, and hands-on
          labs, placing a special emphasis on inclusive innovation and community-driven learning.

# 🌐 TechCon 2024 — HTML Website Project

This repository contains my **Intro to HTML practice project**, where I am building a fully structured, multi-page website for the **TechCon 2024 Conference** as part of my ALX Frontend Web Development learning journey.

The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of **HTML5**, semantic structure, links, forms, tables, and webpage layout while creating a real-world conference website.

## 📁 Project Overview

The website is made up of **five core HTML pages**, each focusing on essential HTML concepts and best practices:

### 1. 🏠 Homepage — `index.html`
The main landing page that introduces **TechCon 2024** and provides navigation links to all other pages on the website.

### 2. ℹ️ About Page — `about.html`
A detailed page covering the **history**, **mission**, and **notable speakers** of the TechCon conference.

### 3. 📅 Schedule Page — `schedule.html`
A clear and accessible **event schedule** presented using HTML tables.  
This page lists sessions, time slots, and speakers.

### 4. 📝 Register Page — `register.html`
A user-friendly **registration form** where attendees can sign up for the conference.  
This page uses form elements such as inputs, labels, checkboxes, radio buttons, and a submit button.

### 5. 📞 Contact Page — `contact.html`
A complete contact page containing:
- Email address  
- Social media links  
- An embedded map  
- A simple “Contact Us” form
